### This repository is a fork of https://gitlab.com/2009scape/2009scape which is a community project to implement Old School Runescape as it was in 2009.

### The 2009scape code was modified for my CS 443 final project to permit socket communication with a python client for reinforcement learning training. The python folder contains the code used for training agents to learn to cut trees and bank the logs outside Seer's Village using Double-Q learning.

### Many shortcuts were taken in this code for the sake of time to complete the project, such as rewards provided by both the java server and the python client. I intend on continuing development in a separate repository to produce a Gym-like training environment.
